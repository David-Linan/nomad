NOMAD usage
===========

This chapter describes how to use NOMAD for solving blackbox optimization problems. Functionalities of NOMAD that are considered more advanced such as parallel evaluations are presented in :ref:`advanced_functionalities`.

TODO

Optimization in batch mode
--------------------------

The batch mode allows to separate the evaluation of the objectives and constraints by the blackbox program from NOMAD executable. This mode has the advantage that if your blackbox program crashes, it will not affect NOMAD: The point that caused this crash will simply be tagged as a blackbox failure.
